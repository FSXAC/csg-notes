## Tuesday

So I’m going to try to build gem5 again but using Python 2. The problem (even with a modified /usr/bin/scons) script such that we use python 2 is that it gives an error:

```
Error: Check failed for Python.h header in ['/usr/include/python2.7', '/usr/include/x86_64-linux-gnu/python2.7']
Two possible reasons:
1. Python headers are not installed (You can install the package python-dev on Ubuntu and RedHat)
2. SCons is using a wrong C compiler. This can happen if CC has the wrong value.
CC = gcc
```

But first, I already have both python-dev and python3-dev installed.

In summary, whenever I edit the /usr/bin/scons file such that the shebang is set to `python` instead of `python3`, the above error occurs.

## Wednesday

Installing Vagrant (a VM environment that works in the command line like VirtualBox and Docker). The plan is to use Vagrant to get a fresh install of Ubuntu and hopefully the python environment works better there.

Once I’m in the new linux environment, we need to gather the required packages:

- scons
- python-pip
- pip install six

For vagrant, use these commands:

- vagrant up to start the system
- vagrant ssh to ssh into the systme
- vagrant halt to gracefully shutdown the system
- vagrant destroy to delete all the files of the running system

## Thursday

Revised the procedure from *Wednesday*:

First, we need to install Vagrant and VirtualBox, thne have a vagrant box setup. In thise case I’ve setup the Debian Vagrant:

```shell
sudo apt install virtualbox
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/vagrant/2.2.9/vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb
sudo dpkg -i vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb
sudo apt install -f

; alternatively
sudo apt install vagrant_2.2.9_x86_64.deb
```

Then we create a vagrant box running a slightly older version of Linux/Ubuntu such as Ubuntu 18.04.

```shell
vagrant init ubuntu/bionic64
vagrant up
```

At this point, the Vagrant VM should be running. We can SSH into the computer by this Vagrant command and we are taken into the default shell.

```shell
vagrant ssh

vagrant@ubuntu-bionic: cd /vagrant
```

Note that according to the Vagrant documentation, the `/vagrant` directory in the VM is the same as the root direction where we initialized the vagrant box. So here is where we clone/copy the required files such as the *gem5_speculativemod* folder.

Installing the dependencies needed to build the ARM/gem5.opt:

```shell
# Check Python and Python 3
which python
which python3

# Install packages
sudo apt install build-essential scons python-pip

# Install python pacakges
pip install six

# Install zlip
sudo apt install zlib1g-dev

# Install m4 macro processor
sudo apt install m4

# Install boost
sudo apt install libboost-all-dev

# Install compiler for the ARM bootloader
sudo apt install gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu

# Yeah what the hell
sudo apt-get install -y make gcc bc gcc-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-4.8-aarch64-linux-gnu gcc-4.8-arm-linux-gnueabihf gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf device-tree-compiler gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
sudo apt-get install libc6-armel-cross libc6-dev-armel-cross binutils-arm-linux-gnueabi libncurses5-dev build-essential bison flex libssl-dev bc
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf g++-arm-linux-gnueabihf
sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi g++-arm-linux-gnueabi
```

Build the project using the `scons` build command:

```shell
rm -rf build && scons build/ARM/gem5.opt
```

Note that typically on my own (Non-VM) PC I would add the option `-j4` or `-j8` so that it compiles faster. But this might lead to running out of virtual memory for the VM so don’t actually add it.

Also note that this may take a while on the VM. Since we’re SSH’ed into the machine, I’d recommend using *screen* or *tmux* to manage terminal sessions just in case SSH pipe breaks due to inactivity or crappy internet.

## Friday

So I tried to figure out why, after building the `gem5.opt` without errors, that initiating the simulator leads to a Python path error. In particular, in `config/common/SysPath.py`, gem5 has a built-in class/function to locate paths for disks, binaries, and scripts. They’re under the subdirectories of “/disks”, “/binaries”, and “/boot” respectively. It also uses the environment variable “M5_PATH” to build part of its full path.

I also changed the location of where my binaries and disks file live (originally under a separate path somewhere in my Linux system).
