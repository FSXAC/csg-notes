## Wednesday

**Meeting Questions**:

- What are my responsbilities for the next seven days?
  - **Read more into the memory channel exploit Peter briefly explained**.
  - 
- What is the meeting time for the Friday meetings?

**Meeting Notes:**

- Peter fixed more bugs with cache, and gem5 is pretty much running on his PC. There was some problems with the partition ‚Äî but it‚Äôs now up to Prashant to compile SPEC for ARM and then have that built in into a disk image.

- The error is similar to the one we‚Äôve seen in Week 28 Saturday (for when we try to run the other `fs.py` from config):

  ```
  [    0.228601] VFS: Cannot open root device "vfat" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
  [    0.228645] Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
  [    0.228695] fe00         1048320 vda
  [    0.228697]  driver: virtio_blk
  [    0.228739]   fe01         1048288 vda1 00000000-01
  [    0.228740]
  [    0.228780] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
  ```

Security paper from Prashant‚Äôs project:

- 30% complete
- There was some experiments that there are side channels in memory systems, where one process flood the memory and other process can see the 
- There are row buffers that offer lower latency, but this can be observed. 
- One process can slow down other process.
- Come up with a scheduling policy so that we don‚Äôt pay as much performance loss. 
- The state of art has either large performance loss compared to baseline (unsecure)
- We can treat everybody equally and that‚Äôs fine. 
- Have a small chance of leaking that information, but every so often re-randomize everything



Cache is a stateful side channel. Port contention and DRAM contention is more of a transient side channel ‚Äî Peter suggest we need to look at how arbiter play a role.

**ü§æüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Between now and Friday:**

- Read the draft paper with a grain of salt.
- Look up re-randomization.

Try to understand the approaches with ‚Äúhow they do this rerandomization‚Äù (Caeser)???

## Thursday

Slide 1:

- What is memory endurance

Slide 2:

- so MAC is a big part of the energy usage throughout the layers
- What was only 8.9% of the energy usage is now almost 50% of the total energy

Slide 3, 4:

## Friday

### Reading into Prashant‚Äôs Draft Paper on Memory Side Channel Vulnerabilities

- One question that comes up over and over again is what does it mean when a row-buffer is ‚Äúopen‚Äù or ‚Äúclosed‚Äù.
- I understand that since access to memory (DRAM) is relatively much slower, because of locality, instead of just ‚Äúreturning‚Äù one byte/word/dword of the address at a time, it is streamed to a row-buffer. Kind of like pre-fetching and caching, the performance is greatly increased if there is a **hit**.
