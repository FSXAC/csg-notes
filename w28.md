### Reading

Paper: **Speculative Taint Tracking (STT)**: A Comprehensive Protection for Speculatively Accessed Data (Oct 2019)

**First Pass**:
- The paper presents a way to mark (taint) data that need to be protected
- Then the data gets untainted once the branch/instructions (?) become unspeculative to boost performance
- The technique should block all covert channels (implicit and explict branches) 

Questions:
- Still don't fully understand the differenece between implicit and explicit instructions, as well as implicit and explicit branches
- What are the difference between *access* vs _transmission_ instructions?
- still don't know the inner mechanism of how this works
- the paper talks extensively about changes to the *front end* and *back end* of architectures. But what does that architecture look like? The front end is responsible for fetching instructions, and the backend is for retiring instructions (i think)
- Why does the solution presented in the paper doens't deal with retired states/instructions that is made to be retired? When does this happen in a program?
- Still don't fully understand prediction vs resolution based leakage

**Second Pass**:


## Wednesday

### Meeting with Prashant & Peter & Mieszko

Date: 2020-07-08

Objective: onboarding for the project to get used to the project to generate ideas or take over.

In terms of cache covert attacks, we are looking at detecting processes/footprints of attack, tracing it back and having some mitigation.

Some stuck/problems we are running into now is that: we need to check if the our scheme is feasible in a real (linux) system. So we need to put processes in real different security domains to test it. We need to look at how accurate this fingerprinting/detection is in terms of detecting false positives.

We need to reason whether if it will collapse or not.

We also need to do a full system simulation to see whether or not this works. Implement the detection scheme in place and use the FS sim to see if this solution falls apart.

We are not particularly looking for a new architecture, but rather a tool for the architects to seek further mititgation. The thing with NewCache is that it is hard to determine who is being malicious. We don't want to isolate processes completely, but when we detect something we want to be able to isolate them.

## Thursday

I'm trying to get a FS simulation running with gem5, folliwng the ARM Research Kit guide (pdf). But in order to build in ARM, looks like I have to have the `.opt` build first. Run this in the root directory of the project:

```shell
scons build/ARM/gem5.opt -j20
```

LOL during the _scons_ build process I get a error code 2:

```txt

```

Not sure what happened, but according to this different wiki page (<http://www.m5sim.org/Build_System>), I run the build options without the -j20 flag. 

Ok, the second try seems more promising. The build is going on.


## Friday

Ok, so the binaries for ARM is built. But I'm having so much trouble trying to get something "fs" to work. For example, I downloaded the Linux kernel, but gem5's dist page 404'd out of nowhere, and I can't find a single page of updated document that details what is needed.

So I played around with the example ARM configuration, using the following build command:

```shell
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_fs.py \
--cpu="minor" \
--num-cores=1 \
--kernel=$M5_KPATH/aarch-system-201901106/
--disk-image=$M5_DPATH/linux-aarch32-ael.img \
--mem-size 8GB
```

Note: originally in the ARM research starter kit guide, we are suppose to make an env variable M5_PATH that points to the downloaded Linux system (http://www.gem5.org/dist/current/arm/aarch-system-20170616.tar.xz) but the link is broken (404).

Also in the downloaded version I had, there is no .img file I needed. Since this needs to be specified upon build:

```shell
# (source: doucment)
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_fs.py --cpu="minor" --num-cores=1 --disk-image=$M5_PATH/disks/linaro-minimal-aarch64.img
```

Yeah, I don't have "linaro-minimal-aarch64.img".... Maybe I'm suppose to copy the other .img file in disk directory into here? I'm not sure, it didn't specify in the documents.

Also, there was an error saying that the DRAMCtrl object in Gem5 works with 8GB but the default starter_fs.py configuration file uses 2GB, so I added `--mem-size 8GB` to "surpress that".

However, I'm still unable to get it to boot, error:

```shell

**Trying again**: ok, I’m gonna try and copy the .img file into the /disks folder fo the downloaded aarch system folder. And then use the default FS build command.

Modified build command:

```sh
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_fs.py --cpu="minor" \
--num-cores=1 --disk-image=$M5_DPATH/linux-aarch32-ael.img \
--mem-size 8GB
```

**NOPE!** since no `--kernel` argument is given, it uses the default values in the *starter_fs.py* file which is some hardcoded name. Fuck that.

Ok, maybe try pointing `--kernel` to one of the items inside the path, not just the main file?

Yeah, ok that worked better.

New build command:

```sh
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_fs.py \
--cpu="minor" \
--kernel=$M5_KPATH/aarch-system-201901106/binaries/vmlinux.arm \
--num-cores=1 \
--disk-image=$M5_KPATH/disks/linux-aarch32-ael.img \
--mem-size 8GB
```

Oops, path error.

### Running 32 bit ARM Linux

The successful build command is as follows:

```shell
#!/usr/bin/zsh

./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/arm/starter_fs.py \
--cpu="minor" \
--kernel=$M5_KPATH/aarch-system-201901106/binaries/vmlinux.arm \
--num-cores=1 \
--disk-image=$M5_KPATH/aarch-system-201901106/disks/linux-aarch32-ael.img \
--mem-size 2GB
```

The kernel and disk image had to be downloaded separately from gem5 website (although at the time of writing, the link is 404).

- I copied the `linux-aarch32-ael.img` file to the kernel disks folder for organization.

- I was able to succesfully *telnet* onto the running Linux machine using:

  ```sh
  telnet localhost 3456
  ```

- But I wasn’t able to do anything because the shell wasn’t accepting any input (?)

## Saturday

So the error I got upon booting the Linux is that “no filesystem could mount root” according to the log, it tried ext2, ext3, ext4, squashfs, vfat, and fuseblk. The resulting error/kernel panic is: `VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(254,0)`.

Checking out `configs/examples/arm/starter_fs.py`, I see that in the script, the kernel commands set Linux root disk image to mount to /dev/vda. 

So I’m going to try changing /dev/vda to whatever ones listed in the error log (vfat, ext2, etc.) and see if it works...

Nope, it doesn’t work:

```
[    0.228601] VFS: Cannot open root device "vfat" or unknown-block(0,0): error -6
[    0.228645] Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here are the available partitions:
[    0.228695] fe00         1048320 vda
[    0.228697]  driver: virtio_blk
[    0.228739]   fe01         1048288 vda1 00000000-01
[    0.228740]
[    0.228780] Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown-block(0,0)
```

Ok, so it turns out I don’t run into these issues if I use the default fs.py configuration file instead! 😡 So now I’m going to modify my run script to comply with the options provided in fs.py instead. The options are located in */config/common/Options.py*.

The new config file looks like this:

```shell
./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/fs.py \
--cpu-type="O3_ARM_v7a_3" \
--kernel=$M5_PATH/binaries/vmlinux.arm64 \
--disk-image=$M5_PATH/disks/linaro-minimal-aarch64.img \
--mem-size 2GB \
--caches \
--l2cache
```

Additionally, since the simulation takes a long time, it may take a while for messages in the terminal to appear, and SSH seem to always disconnect due to time out. So I used `tmux` to manage terminal sessions.

### TMUX

- List sessions: `tmux ls`, `tmux list-sessions`
- New session: `tmux new -s <session-name>`
- Detach from session (do this before exiting SSH): <kbd>^</kbd><kbd>b</kbd> then <kbd>d</kbd>
- To resume / attach session: `tmux attach -t <session-name>`
- To kill a session: `tmux kill-session -t <session-name>`

## Sunday

Available FS CPU types: (choose from 'O3_ARM_v7a_3', 'AtomicSimpleCPU', 'ex5_big', 'DerivO3CPU', 'MinorCPU', 'HPI', 'ex5_LITTLE', 'NonCachingSimpleCPU', 'TimingSimpleCPU')

For some reason all of the CPU types available in fs.py are lot slower than I thought. 

New build script:

```shell
export M5_PATH=/user/

./build/ARM/gem5.opt configs/example/fs.py \
--cpu-type="O3_ARM_v7a_3" \
--kernel=$M5_PATH/binaries/vmlinux.arm64 \
--disk-image=$M5_PATH/disks/linaro-minimal-aarch64.img \
--mem-size 2GB \
--caches \
--l2cache
```
