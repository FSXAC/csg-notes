### Adding SPEC2006 Benchmark to Linaro Image

So I added the SPEC2006 Benchmark using the following procedure:

1. Mount the original image (1.1 GB) to Linux system using a mount utility, this creates a directory in which we can access under `/media/muchen/<some random hex>`

2. Use `dd` to make a new image file:

   ```shell
   dd if=/dev/zero of=new_linaro.img bs=1M count=4096
   ```

   Here I make a 4.3 GB empty image file.

3. Format the image. Note that I tried both `ext2` (I think this is the format of the original image file) and `ext4` (the newest).

   ```shell
   mkfs ext4 -F new_linaro.img
   ```

4. Mount the image

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /media/muchen/gem5vm && sudo mount -o loop,rw,sync new_linaro.img /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

5. Enable permission on the mounted disk (I had to do this every time the image is mounted for some reason)

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R ug+rw /media/muchen/gem5vm
   sudo chown $USERNAME: /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

6. Copy the content of the original Linaro image into the newly created image:

   ```shell
   cp -ax <path to content of mounted linaro image> /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

7. Copy the SPEC2006 binaries into the new image

   ```shell
   cp <path to SPEC2006 bin> /media/muchen/gem5vm/bin
   ```

8. Unmount image

   ```shell
   sudo unmount new_linaro.img
   ```

### Trying to Boot Using New Image

- [`ext2` version] Gives me the error that it couldn’t be mounted.
- [`ext4` version] Also gives me the error that it couldn’t be mounted.

The error:

```
VFS: Cannot open root device "sda1" or unknown-block(8,1): error -6
Please append a correct "root=" boot option; here rae the available partitions:
0800				4194304 sda
 driver: sd
Kernel panic - not syncing: VFS: Unable to mount root fs on unknown block(8,1)
```

Hmm, maybe I should look for a root device option.

### Not Booting in Vanilla Linaro Image?

So I tried just booting up normal Linaro disk image. It does mount correct :). But it hangs during boot at `INIT: Version 2.88 booting` and nothing happens after.

Mieszko suggests that perhaps running the default program, we can specify some boot parameter such that we just run the shell after kernel starts up. How it works (how he describes) is that after boot loader (loads kernel image) has some ways to pass parametes to the kernel, and one of those parameters specify what the “init” is.

So now I should look into how to pass in some init parameter such that we don’t get stuck on boot.

Digging through `config/common/Options.py`, two parameters stands out:

- `-c cMD`, `--cmd CMD`: specify the binary to run in syscall emulations mode.
  - I’m not sure if this is the right place to look since syscall emulation mode is not what we’re doing.
- `-o OPTIONS`, `--options=OPTIONS`: the options to pass to the binary, use `“ ”` around the entire string. This is useful when you are running a command which takes options. you can pass both arguments and options through this variable.

However, looking at the `Options.py` both of these options seems only to be availabe in SE mode. Despite gem5 documentation saying these are “common options” for SE and FS mode.

Under `addFSOptions()` function in the same file, there are two options:

- `--command-line=CL`: Template for the kernel command line. ❓
- `--command-line-file=File with a template for the kernel command line`. ❓

I’m not too sure what or how to use these options. Maybe this could be useful?

### Setting Root Device

From the previous-previous section, I should probably follow the suggestion in the error message.

Aha! In `addFSOptions()`, there is an option `--root-device=ROOTDEV`: OS device name for root partition. So let’s try again using the same launch script but with the added root device argument:

```
...
--root-device=sda \
...
```

**Hypothesis**: so what I’m guessing could be happening here is that during the copying process of the files inside the image. THe “files” under `/dev` including partitions could not be copied. So maybe I should use a utility program to copy *exactly* — if the above options still doesn’t work because other devices are missing.
