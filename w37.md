### Adding SPEC2006 Benchmark to Linaro Image

So I added the SPEC2006 Benchmark using the following procedure:

1. Mount the original image (1.1 GB) to Linux system using a mount utility, this creates a directory in which we can access under `/media/muchen/<some random hex>`

2. Use `dd` to make a new image file:

   ```shell
   dd if=/dev/zero of=new_linaro.img bs=1M count=4096
   ```

   Here I make a 4.3 GB empty image file.

3. Format the image. Note that I tried both `ext2` (I think this is the format of the original image file) and `ext4` (the newest).

   ```shell
   mkfs ext4 -F new_linaro.img
   ```

4. Mount the image

   ```shell
   sudo mkdir -p /media/muchen/gem5vm && sudo mount -o loop,rw,sync new_linaro.img /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

5. Enable permission on the mounted disk (I had to do this every time the image is mounted for some reason)

   ```shell
   sudo chmod -R ug+rw /media/muchen/gem5vm
   sudo chown $USERNAME: /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

6. Copy the content of the original Linaro image into the newly created image:

   ```shell
   cp -ax <path to content of mounted linaro image> /media/muchen/gem5vm
   ```

7. Copy the SPEC2006 binaries into the new image

   ```shell
   cp <path to SPEC2006 bin> /media/muchen/gem5vm/bin
   ```

8. Unmount image

   ```shell
   sudo unmount new_linaro.img
   ```

### Trying to Boot Using New Image

- [`ext2` version] Gives me the error that it couldnâ€™t be mounted 

So I tried just booting up normal Linaro disk image. It does mount correct :). But it hangs during boot at `INIT: Version 2.88 booting` and nothing happens after.
