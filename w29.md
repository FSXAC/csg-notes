While running gem5 on the ECE server, I constantly observe that the gem5 simulation process getting killed with an exit code 152. Turns out on Linux code 152 means an exit signal sent by the OS saying that the process is taking too much memory. ðŸ˜¢

Running the simulation on my local machine seem to work better.

The PIDs running on the simulated Linux system are non-zero, which means that we can use the existing processes to test the new cache Peter developed. Otherwise, we need to write our own test programs. (eventhough I feel like eventually we need to write our own test programs anyway).

### Security Meeting

Preshantâ€™s main concern is maybe Bolin should cross compile SPEC benchmark to ARM. Peter wants SPEC be built into the system image so we can use it.

Itâ€™s a bit difficult because images are perfectly sized, so in order to put more stuff onto it we need to expand the image. 

The `ps` showed that basically no processes that are useful are running, but we still need two concurrent processes to run. Perhaps we can run multiple SPEC processes at the same time that somehow accesses shared memory and measure the false positive rates.

One perhaps good way is to run two SPECâ€™s at the same time. Hyperthreading to be disabled. Perhaps last-level cache be point of interest of measurements?

They talked about two designs:

1. One design where each processes are hard-separated. The different cores donâ€™t communicate. For each process, you could make it like round-robin where it is secure. But alternative idea is that instead of doing one access, you do multiple access and if youa ccess different banks, you could pipeline the opening row for reading. 
2. Allow sharing between cores?

Access to work Peter has done on the cache modifications: <https://github.com/peterdeutsch/gem5_speculativecachemod>, within the branch called *newcache*.
